**Algorithm Choice**

I implemented the *Dijkstra Algorithm* for uninformed search to find the shortest path by expanding all nodes till reach the destination node which needed. I keep tracking the nodes I traveled and their iternations from each process. 

```python
@timeit
def dijkstra(start, end, graph):
    shortest = {}
    cur = PriorityQueue(len(graph.nodes) ** 2)
    cur.put((0.0, (start, -1)))
    i = 0
    while not cur.empty():
        dist, (node, lastNode) = cur.get()
        if node in shortest:
            continue
        shortest[node] = (dist, lastNode)
        if node == end:
            break
        for _, neighbour, d in graph.edges[node]:
            if neighbour in shortest:
                continue
            cur.put((dist + d, (neighbour, node)))
            i += 1
    print(f"Iteration for {i} times")
    
    return parse_path(start, end, shortest)
```

Secondly, I implemented  *A\* Algorithm* for informed search to find the shortest path. It has a Heuristic function to get estimation of cost to destination and estimate of cost to reach the destination then take that into consideration for path finding.

```python
@timeit
def a_star(start, end, graph):
    def heuristic(lhs, rhs):
        lhs = graph.get_node(lhs)
        rhs = graph.get_node(rhs)
        return abs(lhs.x - rhs.x) + abs(lhs.y - rhs.y)
    shortest = {}
    open_list = PriorityQueue(len(graph.nodes) ** 2)
    open_list.put((0.0, (start, -1, 0)))
    i = 0
    while not open_list.empty():
        f, (node, last_node, path_length) = open_list.get()
        if node in shortest and path_length >= shortest[node][0]:
            continue
        shortest[node] = (path_length, last_node)
        if node == end:
            break
        for _, neighbour, d in graph.edges[node]:
            if neighbour in shortest:
                continue
            g = path_length + d
            f = g + heuristic(neighbour, end)
            open_list.put((f, (neighbour, node, g)))
            i += 1
    print(f"Iteration for {i} times")

    return parse_path(start, end, shortest)
```

Both searching algorithms are wraped by timer which imported from time package and calculates run time for each search process. 

**Script Running**

Follow the usage of this script as follows. Please note this script is based on Python 3.7. 

```shell
$ python main.py graphs/[path] --start [] --end []
```

```shell
$ python main.py graphs/graph500_0.4 --start 20 --end 90
Start [a_star]:
Iteration for 21725 times
End [a_star].  Time elapsed: 0.065 sec.
Shortest path from 20 to 90:
[(20, 0), (372, 11.0), (282, 15.0), (349, 16.0), (90, 38.0)]

Start [dijkstra]:
Iteration for 28313 times
End [dijkstra].  Time elapsed: 0.081 sec.
Shortest path from 20 to 90:
[(20, 0.0), (372, 11.0), (282, 15.0), (349, 16.0), (90, 38.0)]
```

Where the [path] is the graph path and --start, --end are start and end point inputs. If no start or end point input, it will randomly genrate them. 

``` shell
$ python main.py graphs/graph500_0.4
Start [a_star]:
Iteration for 38786 times
End [a_star].  Time elapsed: 0.147 sec.
Shortest path from 448 to 424:
[(448, 0), (256, 2.0), (410, 13.0), (92, 17.0), (293, 18.0), (110, 20.0), (71, 26.0), (79, 32.0), (424, 48.0)]

Start [dijkstra]:
Iteration for 44337 times
End [dijkstra].  Time elapsed: 0.121 sec.
Shortest path from 448 to 424:
[(448, 0.0), (256, 2.0), (410, 13.0), (92, 17.0), (293, 18.0), (110, 20.0), (71, 26.0), (79, 32.0), (424, 48.0)]
```

**Result Analysis**

As discussed on previouse lectures, the A* algorithm should faster than Dijkasra algorithm. Also we can see that from above running results on shell since A* algorithm always has less iteration  time than Dijkstra. For all graphs run time comparsion please refer to chart below where A* is always faster than Dijkasra algorithm.
